## [The Go Programming Language](http://golang.org)

### Documentation

The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more productive. 

Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.

### Installing Go

#### [Getting Started](install.en-US.markdown)

Instructions for downloading and installing the Go compilers, tools, and libraries.

### Learning Go

#### [A Tour of Go](http://tour.golang.org/)

An interactive introduction to Go in three sections. The first section covers basic syntax and data structures; the second discusses methods and interfaces; and the third introduces Go's concurrency primitives. Each section concludes with a few exercises so you can practice what you've learned. You can [take the tour online](http://tour.golang.org/) or [install it locally](http://code.google.com/p/go-tour/).

### [How to write Go code](http://golang.org/doc/code.html)

How to use the [go command](http://golang.org/cmd/go/) to fetch, build, and install packages, commands, and run tests.

### [Effective Go](http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)

A document that gives tips for writing clear, idiomatic Go code. A must read for any new Go programmer. It augments the tour and the language specification, both of which should be read first.

### [Go References](http://golang.org/ref/)

Language specification, memory model, and detailed documentation for the commands and packages.

### [Getting Started with Go on App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/go/gettingstarted/)

How to develop and deploy a simple Go project with [Google App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/).

### Talks

The talks marked with a red asterisk (*) were written before Go 1 and contain some examples that are no longer correct, but they are still of value. 

### [A Video Tour of Go](http://research.swtch.com/gotour)

Three things that make Go fast, fun, and productive: interfaces, reflection, and concurrency. Builds a toy web crawler to demonstrate these. 

### [Go Concurrency Patterns](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6kdp27TYZs)

Concurrency is the key to designing high performance network services. Go's concurrency primitives (goroutines and channels) provide a simple and efficient means of expressing concurrent execution. In this talk we see how tricky concurrency problems can be solved gracefully with simple Go code. 

### [Meet the Go team](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sln-gJaURzk)

 A panel discussion with David Symonds, Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, Ken Thompson, Andrew Gerrand, and Brad Fitzpatrick. 

### [Writing Web Apps in Go*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-i0hat7pdpk)

 A talk by Rob Pike and Andrew Gerrand presented at Google I/O 2011. It walks through the construction and deployment of a simple web application and unveils the [Go runtime for App Engine](http://blog.golang.org/2011/05/go-and-google-app-engine.html). See the [presentation slides](http://talks.golang.org/2011/Writing_Web_Apps_in_Go.pdf). 

### [Go Programming*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgVhBThJdXc)

 A presentation delivered by Rob Pike and Russ Cox at Google I/O 2010. It illustrates how programming in Go differs from other languages through a set of examples demonstrating features particular to Go. These include concurrency, embedded types, methods on any type, and program construction using interfaces.
