## How to Read This Book

New users
> Your administrator has probably set up Subversion already, and you need to learn how to use the client. If you've never used a version control system, then Chapter 1, Funda- mental Concepts is a vital introduction to the ideas behind version control. Chapter 2,Basic Usage is a guided tour of the Subversion client.

Advanced users
> Whether you're a user or administrator, eventually your project will grow larger. You're
going to want to learn how to do more advanced things with Subversion, such as howto use Subversion's property support (Chapter 3, Advanced Topics), how to use branches and perform merges (Chapter 4, Branching and Merging), how to configure runtime options (Chapter 7, Customizing Your Subversion Experience), and other things. These chapters aren't critical at first, but be sure to read them once you're com-fortable with the basics.

Developers
> Presumably, you're already familiar with Subversion, and now want to either extend it or build new software on top of its many APIs. Chapter 8, Embedding Subversion is just for you.
