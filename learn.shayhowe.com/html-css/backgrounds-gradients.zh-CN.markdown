### Backgrounds & Gradients

Backgrounds are an important part to CSS as they allow you to easily change the composition of an element. They can be used for decoration while setting the scene within an element. They can provide visual context for an elementâ€™s content, enhancing usability. With use cases large and small, backgrounds have a significant impact on the overall design of a website.

Adding a background to an element can be accomplished in a few different ways, most often in the form of a solid color, an image, or a combination of the two. The ability to control exactly how a background is implemented on an element provides greater direction to the overall appearance.

With CSS3, new [backgrounds and capabilities](http://www.slideshare.net/maxdesign/css3-backgrounds) were introduced, including the ability to include gradient backgrounds and multiple background images on a single element. These progressions are becoming widely supported within all browsers and expand the possibilities of modern web design.
