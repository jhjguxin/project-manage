# Database Support

Sails uses [Waterline](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline) as its ORM, and supports all databases which have waterline adapters:

- [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/particlebanana/sails-postgresql) - **0.9+ compatible** - sails-postgresql
- [MySQL](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-mysql) - **0.9+ compatible** - sails-mysql
- [MongoDB](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-mongo) - **0.9+ compatible** - sails-mongo
- [Memory](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-memory) - **0.9+ compatible** - sails-memory
- [Disk](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-memory) - **0.9+ compatible** - sails-disk

## Developing Custom Adapters

If the database you need isn't listed above, you can help contribute to an existing project or create your own. Check out https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/wiki/custom-adapters to learn more about that.

## In-Progress Community Adapters

- [Redis](https://github.com/vanetix/sails-redis)
- [Riak](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-riak)
- [Couch](https://github.com/craveprogramminginc/sails-couchdb)

## Other Community Adapters

Also, adapters are not limited to databases. The Sails.js ORM (Waterline) can be hooked up to communiate with any asynchronous web service! Web services like [LDAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol), Active Directory, and even things like Twitter and Facebook can be accessed via the ORM through adapters. You can get pretty avante garde here.
